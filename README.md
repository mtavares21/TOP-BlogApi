# TOP-Blog Api

This is the first part of The Odin Project's Blog project, using jamstack architecture to build a blog.

In this repo you can find the source code to the blog API, the backend part of the project, used to make all the necessary
CRUDE operations in the Mongo Database.

The API is then used in two client side apps, both build with React: [Blog Public](https://github.com/mtavares21/TOP-BlogPublic) and Blog Admin (in developement).
